# Acme Resources

Notes and supporting files for the Acme text editor.

## Documents

- [setup.md](setup.md): Setting up Acme on a Unix(-like) system.
- [hardware.md](hardware.md): Hardware (mice and keyboards) that are
  best when using Acme.
- [links.md](links.md): Collection of Acme-related links.

## Code

- [bin/a](bin/a) is an Acme launch script.  There are many like it, but this
  one is mine.
- [bin/Eput](bin/Eput) is a crude solution for tab expansion.
- See also [ixtenu/script](https://github.com/ixtenu/script), which has several
  scripts that are useful within Acme (and elsewhere, which is why they are not
  in this repository).

## Patches

- [acme-dark-theme.patch](acme-dark-theme.patch): Acme's (in)famous yellow and
  blue color theme is not to everyone's tastes, but can be changed by lightly
  patching the source code.
